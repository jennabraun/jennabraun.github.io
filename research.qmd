## Current Research

For my PhD research, I synthesize field data with spatial data collected from remote sensing satellites and large biodiversity databases to answer questions about ant community assembly in the Mojave Desert. My goal is to understand the ecological relationships that connect factors measured at tiny scales, like ant morphological traits, to large scales like species ranges and projected climate change scenarios.

## Research Themes

### Desert Ant Community Ecology & Climate Change

My doctoral research investigates how environmental filtering shapes desert ant communities across spatial scales, from local microhabitats to regional climatic gradients. I use species distribution modeling to forecast how climate change will alter plant-ant mutualisms, and conduct field experiments to understand how resource availability mediates ant-plant interactions.

### Endangered Species Conservation & Habitat Modeling

I have collaborated extensively with US federal agencies on research supporting endangered species recovery. As Principal Investigator on a Bureau of Land Management contract, I led research characterizing arthropod prey availability for the blunt-nosed leopard lizard (*Gambelia sila*). This work combined field surveys, habitat suitability modeling, and remote sensing to inform land management and species recovery planning. I also contributed to research by classifying satelite data and creating resource selection models, and conducting systematic literature reviews to support conservation planning.

### Plant Facilitation & Desert Species Interactions

Foundation plant species such as shrubs play critical roles in structuring desert communities by ameliorating harsh environmental conditions. My research examines how shrubs facilitate arthropod and plant communities across climatic gradients, and how increasing aridity under climate change may alter these positive interactions.

### Pollinator-Mediated Facilitation

My Master's research investigated how foundation shrubs influence pollinator visitation to associated plants in the Mojave Desert. I developed a conceptual framework for pollinator-mediated facilitation through a systematic literature review and tested these mechanisms using field observations and network analysis.

### Invasive Species Ecology

Invasive grasses such as *Bromus rubens* (red brome) threaten native plant communities across western North American deserts. My research examines the competitive effects of invasive grasses on native annual plants and how factors like water availability, seed density, and light intensity mediate invasion outcomes.
