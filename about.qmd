### Jenna Braun

I am a community ecologist and data scientist studying plant-insect interactions in dryland ecosystems. My research synthesizes field experiments with computational methods including species distribution modeling, machine learning, and remote sensing to address questions in conservation and environmental management.

I have collaborated with US federal agencies on endangered species research and am committed to open science practices that enhance the accessibility and impact of ecological research. I currently serve as Handling Editor for EcoEvoRxiv.

## Research Interests

- Desert community ecology & climate change
